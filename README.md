Create psychological tests/quizes with scales connected with results through simple formulas like "extraversion > 50%"

## Description ##

With the help of this plugin now you can create typical and advanced psychological tests (quizes, assessments).

Typical psychological test consists of questions and answers. A respondent answers all of the qoestions and gets results. This is how the box outside looks like.

Inside the box we also have scales each connected with the particular answer with scores and results, that are calculated with the help of simple formulas like: "extraversion > 50%". Where "extraversion" is a sum of respondent's scores from extraversion scale. We didn't invent anything new — all this has been already invented in 19th century.

Test answers, scales, results and categories are edited through wordpress standard editors, similar to categories editor. You can associate them in sidebar. Whether test questions, answers and formulas are edited with standard wordpress metaboxes, behind content. You can even reorder them if you like. At the top of content editor you have button for quick access to those metaboxes: Add New Questions, Edit Questions, Edit Formulas.

As to formulas you can be sure — we have simple formula editor, that has buttons for each scale (with sum of it's scores) and allowed comparisions.
