Create psychological tests/quizes with scales connected to results through simple formulas like "extraversion > 50%"

## Description ##

With help of this plugin you now can create typical and advanced psychological tests (quizes, assessments).

Typical psychological test consists of questions and answers. Respondent chooses all answers and gets results. This is outside the box.

Inside we have also scales connected to each answer with scores and results, that are calculated with help of simple formulas like: "extraversion > 50%". Where "extraversion" is a sum of respondent's scores from extraversion scale. We didn't invented the wheel — all this already have been invented in 19th century. 

Test answers, scales, results and categories are edited through wordpress standard editors, similar to categories editor. You can associate them in sidebar. Whether test questions, answers and formulas are edited with standard wordpress metaboxes, behind content. You even can reorder them if you like. At the top of content editor you have button for quick access of those metaboxes: Add New Questions, Edit Questions, Edit Formulas.

Regarding formulas you can be calm — we have simple formula editor, that have buttons for each scale (with sum of it's scores) and allowed comparisions.
