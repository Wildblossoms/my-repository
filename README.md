Create psychological tests/quizes with scales connected with results through simple formulas like "extraversion > 50%"

## Description ##

With the help of this plugin now you can create typical and advanced psychological tests (quizes, assessments).

Typical psychological test consists of **questions** and **answers**. A respondent answers all of the questions and gets **results**. This is how the box outside looks like.

Inside the box we also have **scales** each connected with the particular answer with **scores** and **results**, that are calculated with the help of **simple formulas** like: "extraversion > 50%". Where "extraversion" is a sum of respondent's scores from extraversion scale. We didn't invent anything new — all this has been already invented in 19th century.

Thanks a lot! :)

Test answers, scales, results and categories are edited through **wordpress standard editors**, similar to categories editor. You can associate them in sidebar. Whether test questions, answers and formulas are edited with standard wordpress metaboxes, behind content. You can even reorder them if you like by drag-n-drop. At the top of content editor you have **button for quick access** to those metaboxes: Add New Questions, Edit Questions and Scores, Edit Formulas. If you want more control then you are allowed to add to them not allowed out-of-the box HTML tags like: headers, lists, images, hr and "read more" tag taken from post editor.

**Answers**  can be global to test — when all questions have the same answers. For example: "Yes", "No", "I'm not sure". Or you can use **individual answers** to add individual answer to each question. And the third option is to use global answers, but individualize their titles: not just "Yes", but "Yes, I do so and so", when you use it for the particular question. Some tests have this pattern.

As to **formulas** you can be sure — we have simple formula editor, that has buttons for each scale (with sum of it's scores) and allowed comparisions.

Tests are treated for WordPress like posts — they appear on home page and inside their categories pages if selected. But if you don't want your test to appear on home page you can uncheck **"Publish on the home page"** in "Publish" metabox and this particular test will not appear on homepage.

To minimize author's time we have **Quick Fill** for questions and scores. You can **quick fill questions from text** and they will fill appropriate fields. Same way you can **Quick Fill Scores** in many questions some answer+scale combination.

Respondent will get **results** on it's own individual passing page, which will allow share it. **Passings** are saved in DB with respondent's ip and device unique identifier. They are shown at "Respondents' results" table under "Tests" menu. It allow to see if someone will have many passings from same computer/smartphone/another device, which scales/results respondent have for concrete passing and ability to open it from there. If respondent was a logged in user — then you will see it in "Username" column with a link to profile.

**Test** page can be customized: reset answers on "Back" button, use your own caption for "Get Test Result" button, allow multiple answers per question, show percentage of answered questions and show one question per page.
**Results** page also can be customized: when you need to show/hide scales or test description on it; when you want to show scales chart or sort scales by scores sum.

Wp-testing localized into twelve languages: English, Russian, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Bulgarian, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Brazilian and Spanish. English, Russian, French, Dutch, Bulgarian, Italian, Turkish, Chinese, Brazilian and Spanish have good quality (native speakers) — others need review. You can easily add your language through excellent [Transifiex](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/wp-testing/) service. **Translators** and *reviewers* are kindly welcome! See http://wp-translations.org/join/ for instructions.

**Quality** and **compatibility** are taken really seriously. Plugin tested on [44 combinations](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing) of WordPress (from 3.2 to 4.2) and PHP (from 5.2 to 5.5) plus two custom combinations for old MySQL storage engine (MyISAM) and with few popular plugins. So you can be sure, that it will just work, even if you don't have  the latest WordPress or your hosting doesn't have the latest versions of PHP/MySQL. [Build status image](https://travis-ci.org/garex/wp-testing.svg?branch=develop) is available.
